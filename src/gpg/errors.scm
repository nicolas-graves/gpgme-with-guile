;;; Commentary:

;; Error handling is an important issue with any library system, but
;; it is of particular concern within GPGME/G since an unhandled error
;; may indeed corrupt some very important (and quite possibly
;; irreplaceable!) data.

;;; Code:

(define-module (gpg errors)
  #:use-module (system foreign)
  #:use-module (ice-9 format)
  #:export     (gpg:error-code->error
		gpg:error->error-code
		gpg:describe-error))

(define gpg-error-lib (dynamic-link "libgpg-error"))
