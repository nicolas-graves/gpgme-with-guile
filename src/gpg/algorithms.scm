;;; Commentary:

;; Data encryption uses a number of algorithms, and GPGME/G supports
;; many, both for use with public keys as well as data verification
;; hashes.
;;
;; For the most part, this module does not actually use the underlying
;; GPGME library since the functions and datastructurens used by GPGME
;; are very simple; implementing them in Scheme is both simpler and
;; faster than calling to the underlying C library.  Having said that,
;; we provide translation procedures for passing algorithm information
;; to other GPGME functions

;;; Code:

  #:use-module (system foreign))
