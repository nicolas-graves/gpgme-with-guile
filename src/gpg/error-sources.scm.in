;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines all of the error sources provided by
;; libgpg-error.  There are a great many of them!  All sources and
;; their associated numeric value have been extracted from
;; <gpg-error.h> with a basic transformation in the following vein:
;;
;;    GPG_ERR_SOURCE_[A-Z_]+[A-Z] -> error-source/[a-z-]+[a-z]
;;
;; Example: GPG_ERR_SOURCE_UNKNOWN -> error-source/unknown
;;
;; Every effort has been made to document each source, but there are
;; invariably some omissions due to incomplete documentation upstream.
;; course of using GPGME/G, so hopefully things won't get too cryptic.
;;
;; The code in this file should only ever be run when it's loaded by
;; @code{errors.scm}; therefore, we are keeping the module loading to
;; a minimum---if the module is used by @code{errors.scm}, then it
;; isn't loaded here.

;;; Code:

(define-immutable-record-type gpg-error-source
  (make-error-source source description)
  error-source?
  (source get-source-value)
  (description get-source-description))

;;; BEGIN ERROR SOURCES

;;; END ERROR SOURCES
(define *error-source-dim* @@ERROR_SOURCE_DIM@@)

(define *source-codes->sources*
  (alist->vhash
@@ERROR_SOURCE_LOOKUP@@
   hashq))

;;; error-sources.scm ends here
