;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides a binding to the GNU Privacy Guard Made Easy
;; (GPGME) library for Guile, the GNU Ubiquitous Intelligent Language
;; for Extension.  GNU Privacy Guard is a system of encryption
;; techniques and utilities designed to protect users' privacy and
;; freedom.
;;
;; It is my hope that others will find this binding useful, and thus
;; spread awareness of privacy issues and educate the average user
;; about how they can protect themselves and others.  By binding GPGME
;; to Guile, including cryptography tools in your average application
;; should become much easier.  If you're already using Guile to
;; provide users with the ability to extend your program, using
;; GPGME is as easy as (use-modules (gpg)). ***FIXME - create modules
;; and structure***

;;; Code:


(define-module (gpg)
  #:use-module (system foreign)
  #:use-module (ice-9 format)
  #:use-module (ice-9 i18n)
  #:export (check-version
	    context?))
