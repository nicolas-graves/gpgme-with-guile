/* The GPGME function `gpgme_get_engine_info' does not provide a very
 * _clean_ interface: it returns an integer, which should be
 * interpretted as an error code, and then _modifies_ the
 * gpgme_engine_info_t argument passed to it.  This doesn't jive well
 * with the Scheme-way of doing things, thus this wrapper has been
 * devised.
 *
 * We pass in a pointer to a function whose prototype is
 * (f integer) -> symbol (though it is seen as f(SCM) -> SCM in C),
 * the resulting symbol being the key to a thrown error if something
 * goes wrong with the internal call to `gpgme_get_engine_info'.
 *
 * This is all a very convoluted way to sanitize a C function.  :-(
